This is the web client for the BookBnB group project for CS5031 Software Engineering Practice at the University of St. Andrews. It was designed and build by Anthony Makepeace and David Garnitz.It makes use of a Java Spring API built by Riad Ibadulla and David Garnitz, and works in complement with a Java Swing GUI built by Anthony Makepeace and Evaristo Rizzo.  

To run the app, use the terminal to clone the repository, switch into the project root, and run "npm install" then "npm start". This will run a node server on your local host and open a tab in your browser where you can use  the app. 

You may also visit https://antondubek-bookbnbweb.herokuapp.com/ to access the application, although the whole system's configuration makes this very slow. We recommend you run the application locally. 

This project is built on top of the CreateReactApp built by Facebook and uses all the default configurations for that project. It runs in development mode.
